// Bellman-Ford Algorithm to find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph
// Time Complexity: O(V*E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges


// Space Complexity: O(V), where V is the number of vertices

// The space complexity is O(V) because we are using a distance array of size V to store the shortest distances from the source node to all other nodes.
